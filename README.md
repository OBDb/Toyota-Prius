## Generations

The Toyota Prius has evolved through five distinct generations since its debut as the world's first mass-produced hybrid vehicle:

- **First Generation (1997-2003)**: Launched in October 1997 as the world's first mass-produced hybrid passenger vehicle, the original Prius (NHW10) was initially available only in Japan. It featured a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing just 70 horsepower, and the electric motor added another 44 hp. The first of the Toyota Prius generations to be available internationally was codenamed the NHW11, which went on sale in the US in 2000 as a 2001 model. This first generation was a compact sedan with impressive fuel efficiency ratings of 42/41/41 city/highway/combined mpg.

- **Second Generation (2004-2009)**: Presented at the April 2003 New York International Auto Show, for the 2004 US model year, the NHW20 Prius was a complete redesign. It became a compact liftback, sized between the Corolla and the Camry. The second generation introduced the iconic hatchback configuration and featured a new 1.5L four-pot and electric motor that produced 110 combined horsepower, paired with a CVT. Efficiency was up to 48/45/46 mpg, and it had an impressive range of 547 miles. This generation received a facelift for the 2006 model year with updated styling and safety features.

- **Third Generation (2010-2015)**: Produced between the 2010 and 2015 model years, the third-gen Prius continued with the liftback body style of its predecessor. For the 2010 model year, changes to the Toyota Prius formula included a full redesign and a new powertrain - a 1.8L engine replaced the previous 1.5L, and system output was now up to 134 hp. Efficiency once again dominated, with the 2010 Prius capable of returning 51/48/50 mpg, and its range was now almost 600 miles. The third generation received a facelift in 2012 with updated front fascia design and new wheel options.

- **Fourth Generation (2016-2022)**: On sale between the 2016 and 2022 model years, the fourth-gen Prius saw further advances to the car's battery and electric motor technologies. This was the first generation of the Prius to use the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) modular platform, which provides a lower center of gravity and increased structural rigidity. The standard model's 1.8L four-pot and electric motor combine for 121 hp, and the XW50 eventually introduced the first AWD Prius in late 2018, with an electric motor powering the rear wheels. In Eco guise, this Prius managed 58/53/56 mpg, while the AWD variant got up to 50 mpg combined. This generation received a significant facelift for 2019-2022 model years.

- **Fifth Generation (2023-present)**: The fifth-generation Prius was presented on 16 November 2022, marking a dramatic transformation for the hybrid. The Toyota Prius hatchback turns over a new leaf as it enters its fifth generation in 2023. After being possibly the ugliest car on the market the Prius has pupated into a gorgeous butterfly. Built on the next evolution of Toyota's TNGA-C platform, which makes it a leaner but more rigid eco-friendly compact with a wider stance and lower driving position. The first uses Toyota's Series Parallel Hybrid System, available in 1.8-litre (2ZR-FXE) and 2.0-litre (M20A-FXS) variants and producing up to 103 kW (138 hp; 140 PS) and 144 or 146 kW (193 or 196 hp; 196 or 199 PS) respectively. The EPA estimates the Prius is good for 57 mpg in the city and 56 mpg on the highway for the front-wheel drive model. This generation also features a significantly more powerful plug-in hybrid variant with a combined output of 164 kW (220 hp; 223 PS).
